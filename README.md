## Architecture

The system follows clean/hexagonal architecture principles:

```
Domain Layer
├── Entities: Codebase, RefactoringPlan
├── Value Objects: MigrationType, RefactoringResult
├── Services: RefactoringDomainService
└── Ports: Interfaces for external dependencies

Application Layer
└── Use Cases: AnalyzeCodebase, CreateMultiServiceRefactoringPlan, ExecuteMultiServiceRefactoringPlan

Infrastructure Layer
├── Repositories: Codebase, Plan, File storage
├── Adapters: Code analysis, LLM, AST, Testing, Service Mapping
└── Config: Dependency injection

Presentation Layer
├── API: REST endpoints for web and programmatic access
└── UI: React-based web interface
```

## Automatic Git Hooks

This repository includes a post-commit hook that automatically pushes changes to the remote repository when committing to the main branch.

## Installation

```bash
# The system requires Python 3.7+
pip install astor  # For AST transformations
```

## Usage

### Multi-Service Migration

```python
from cloud_refactor_agent.infrastructure.adapters.s3_gcs_migration import create_multi_service_migration_system
from domain.entities.codebase import ProgrammingLanguage

# Create the multi-service migration system
orchestrator = create_multi_service_migration_system()

# Execute a migration with auto-detection
result = orchestrator.execute_migration(
    codebase_path="/path/to/your/codebase",
    language=ProgrammingLanguage.PYTHON
)

print(f"Migration completed: {result['migration_id']}")
print(f"Success: {result['verification_result']['success']}")
print(f"Services migrated: {result['services_migrated']}")

# Or migrate specific services
result = orchestrator.execute_migration(
    codebase_path="/path/to/your/codebase",
    language=ProgrammingLanguage.PYTHON,
    services_to_migrate=["s3", "lambda", "dynamodb"]
)
```

### Using Individual Components

```python
# Initialize a codebase
from application.use_cases import InitializeCodebaseUseCase
from infrastructure.repositories import CodebaseRepositoryAdapter
from infrastructure.adapters import CodeAnalyzerAdapter

init_use_case = InitializeCodebaseUseCase(
    codebase_repo=CodebaseRepositoryAdapter(),
    code_analyzer=CodeAnalyzerAdapter()
)

codebase = init_use_case.execute("/path/to/codebase", ProgrammingLanguage.PYTHON)

# Analyze the codebase for all AWS service usage
from application.use_cases import AnalyzeCodebaseUseCase
analyze_use_case = AnalyzeCodebaseUseCase(
    code_analyzer=CodeAnalyzerAdapter(),
    codebase_repo=CodebaseRepositoryAdapter()
)

analysis_report = analyze_use_case.execute(codebase.id)
print(f"AWS services found: {analysis_report['aws_services_found']}")
```

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect and migrate all supported AWS services
python main.py /path/to/codebase --language python

# Migrate specific services only
python main.py /path/to/codebase --language python --services s3 lambda dynamodb

# Verbose output
python main.py /path/to/codebase --language python --verbose
```

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

## Design Decisions

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The system implements specialized agents:
- **Planner Agent**: Handles analysis, multi-service planning, and task decomposition
- **Refactoring Engine**: Executes transformations using LLM-generated recipes for multiple services
- **Verification Agent**: Ensures quality, correctness, and security across all migrated services

### Service Mapping Framework

The system includes a comprehensive service mapping framework that defines how each AWS service maps to its GCP equivalent, including:
- API call transformations
- Authentication method translations
- Configuration parameter mappings
- Data model adaptations

### Extended AST Transformations

The system uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) manipulation for reliable code transformations across multiple service types, preserving code structure while updating cloud-specific calls.

### Verification and Security

A mandatory verification gate runs tests to ensure behavior preservation across all migrated services, with security checks validating the refactored code for vulnerabilities.

## Performance

The system is designed to:
- Complete analysis within 10 seconds per 100,000 lines of code
- Process an average-sized microservice (<5,000 LoC) within 60 minutes
- Maintain 100% test pass rate after refactoring
- Achieve >70% reduction in resource hours compared to manual migration

## Security

- Proprietary code handling with strict access controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Mandatory review policy before execution
- No use of third-party LLM APIs that train on submitted data

## Roadmap

- Add Infrastructure as Code (IaC) translation capabilities (CloudFormation to Terraform)
- Support for additional programming languages
- Container migration (ECS to GKE)
- Database schema migration capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
